# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (because [Rust makes me](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html#the-version-field), [not because I want to](https://snarky.ca/why-i-dont-like-semver/)).
